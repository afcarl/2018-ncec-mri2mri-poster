  abstract    = "A critical issue in image restoration is the problem of noise
                 removal while keeping the integrity of relevant image
                 information. Denoising is a crucial step to increase image
                 quality and to improve the performance of all the tasks needed
                 for quantitative imaging analysis. The method proposed in this
                 paper is based on a 3-D optimized blockwise version of the
                 nonlocal (NL)-means filter (Buades, et al., 2005). The
                 NL-means filter uses the redundancy of information in the
                 image under study to remove the noise. The performance of the
                 NL-means filter has been already demonstrated for 2-D images,
                 but reducing the computational burden is a critical aspect to
                 extend the method to 3-D images. To overcome this problem, we
                 propose improvements to reduce the computational complexity.
                 These different improvements allow to drastically divide the
                 computational time while preserving the performances of the
                 NL-means filter. A fully automated and optimized version of
                 the NL-means filter is then presented. Our contributions to
                 the NL-means filter are: 1) an automatic tuning of the
                 smoothing parameter; 2) a selection of the most relevant
                 voxels; 3) a blockwise implementation; and 4) a parallelized
                 computation. Quantitative validation was carried out on
                 synthetic datasets generated with BrainWeb (Collins, et al.,
                 1998). The results show that our optimized NL-means filter
                 outperforms the classical implementation of the NL-means
                 filter, as well as two other classical denoising methods
                 [anisotropic diffusion (Perona and Malik, 1990)] and total
                 variation minimization process (Rudin, et al., 1992) in terms
                 of accuracy (measured by the peak signal-to-noise ratio) with
                 low computation time. Finally, qualitative results on real
                 data are presented .",

  abstract    = "The diagonal and off-diagonal elements of the effective
                 self-diffusion tensor, Deff, are related to the echo intensity
                 in an NMR spin-echo experiment. This relationship is used to
                 design experiments from which Deff is estimated. This estimate
                 is validated using isotropic and anisotropic media, i.e.,
                 water and skeletal muscle. It is shown that significant errors
                 are made in diffusion NMR spectroscopy and imaging of
                 anisotropic skeletal muscle when off-diagonal elements of Deff
                 are ignored, most notably the loss of information needed to
                 determine fiber orientation. Estimation of Deff provides the
                 theoretical basis for a new MRI modality, diffusion tensor
                 imaging, which provides information about tissue
                 microstructure and its physiologic state not contained in
                 scalar quantities such as T1, T2, proton density, or the
