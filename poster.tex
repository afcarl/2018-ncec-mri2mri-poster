\section*{Introduction}

The analysis of image data has been a central part of neuroscience research
since its very beginning, but with the more recent accelerated development of
methods to image and record the brain at many different scales, large
collections of digital image data have become available. The size, diversity and
complexity of these data have thrust neuroscience researchers into the era of
\emph{big data}.

There are many software systems that can be harnessed for the analysis of large
image data sets, but comparing these systems is a complex task that requires a
high degree of expertise. This makes the selection of a system for specific
analysis tasks, and for the creation of an analysis pipeline a daunting task.

\color{Navy}

We compared several big data software systems and benchmarked their performance
in a state-of-the-art data processing and analysis pipeline with human
neuroimaging data.

\small

\begin{itemize}
\item Open-source parallel processing framework that enables users to run large-scale data analytics applications across clustered computers.

\item Dataflow-based execution system that provides a functional, collection-oriented API.

\item Parallel tasks are described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- resilience against transient failures by tracking computational lineage

\item Optimizes for data locality when scheduling work.

\item Programming interfaces in Scala, Java, and Python.

\end{itemize}

(\texttt{http://myria.cs.washington.edu/})
\begin{itemize}
  \item Distributed, ``shared-nothing'' big data management system from the University of Washington.

  \item  Derives requirements from real users and complex workflows, especially in science.

   \item Provides a programming model that extends relational algebra with iteration that affords rich, iteration-aware optimization without sacrificing expressive power.

   \item Supports user defined functions (UDFs) in Python.

   \item Also provided as a cloud service that users can access directly through their browser or through a Jupyter notebook.

\end{itemize}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.25\linewidth}
  \includegraphics[height=3cm]{rasdaman-logo.png}
\end{minipage}

(\texttt{http://www.rasdaman.org/})
\begin{itemize}
\item An array database management system designed for storing and querying high-dimensional arrays (such as images).

\item In addition to conventional SQL queries, it allows users to manipulate arrays directly in its own query language called Rasdaman Query Language (Rasql).

\item Also supports other language bindings such as C++, Java, and Python (only available in the Enterprise version).

\item Redirects the data to the underlying database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) or file systems.

\item Users interact with Rasdaman mostly via queries, either through Rasql or programming interfaces; as a consequence, migrating an application to Rasdaman usually requires development effort to translate application logic to queries, and to glue different stages of the pipeline

\end{minipage}

(\texttt{https://www.tensorflow.org/})
\begin{itemize}

\item A graph-based framework recently open-sourced from Google, that provides functionality to express operations to manipulate n-dimensional tensors

\item A directed computational graph is defined for operations (nodes) and tensors (edges).

\item The graph is optimizied and can be deployed on local and distributed systems as well as GPUs and mobile devices.

\item Currently, TensorFlow provides a Python and C++ API.

\end{itemize}

\section*{Materials and Methods}
The human connectome can be assessed \emph{in vivo} using MRI. Diffusion MRI
(dMRI) is used to evaluate the microstructure of white matter, and the local orientation of nerve fibers in each voxel.

\subsection*{Data}

Measurements were obtained from the Human Connectome Project

(\texttt{https://www.humanconnectome.org/}). Measurements in 288 directions of diffusion were obtained at a 1.25 x 1.25 x 1.25 $mm^3$ resolution.

A typical pipeline of MRI analysis might include several steps. We focus here on:
\begin{itemize}

  \item Segmentation: the part of the image containing the brain is identified using the median Otsu algorithm \cite{Otsu1975-qg}.

  \item Denoising: the image within this brain mask is denoise using the non-local means algorithm \cite{Coupe2008-bx}.

 \item Model fitting: a model is fit in every voxel of the measurement. We used the classic DTI model \cite{Basser1994-hg}.

\end{itemize}

\includegraphics[width=25cm]{pipeline.png}

\begin{minipage}[b]{0.75\linewidth}
  Data analysis was based on functions implemented in the open-source Dipy
  software (\texttt{http://dipy.org}).
\end{minipage}

  \includegraphics[width=5cm]{dipy-logo.png}
\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Computational experiments}
We used AWS r3.2xlarge instance type, optimized for memory-intensive applications (lower price per GiB of RAM): each instance has 8 vCPU, 61 GiB Memory and 160 GB SSD storage.

\textbf{Pure Python}: The reference implementation was run on a single instance.

For the distributed computing frameworks that we tested, we used four compute
nodes and one master node.

\textbf{Myria}:   Each compute node ran four workers making for a total of sixteen workers. For this image processing pipeline, Myria was setup with PostgreSQL as the per-node, local storage layer (default configuration).

\textbf{Spark}: Each compute node ran eight workers; spark default is one worker
per CPU, for a total of thirty-two workers. We used spark-1.6.1-bin-hadoop1, in
standalone mode with HDFS as the storage layer. We also used thunder 0.6.0
(\texttt{http://thunder-project.org/}) to set up spark.

\textbf{Rasdaman}: We used the default configuration with  nine Rasdaman server processes on each node. We made reasonable effort to push certain application operations into Rasdaman’s query engine.

\section*{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}

\item Myria performs faster than other systems for most tasks. Some operations still need to be done in Python.

\item Rasdaman requires significant rewriting of algorithms to be used. Some operations still need to be done in Python.

\item  Spark error handling can be cryptic.

\item TensorFlow is still under heavy development, and might be much more performant in the future. Some operations are still not possible (e.g., model fitting)

\end{itemize}

\section*{Future directions}

Future developments include the development of user-defined aggregations in Myria.

Myria will also serve as the computational backend for web-based image processing pipelines we will provide as a service.
